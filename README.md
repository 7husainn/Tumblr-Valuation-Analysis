# Tumblr-Valuation-Analysis

This repository contains the work of our group project focused on evaluating Tumblr's growth and valuation using various data-driven approaches. The project was part of the "Digital Technologies and Value Creation" course (SMM750) in the MSc Business Analytics program. Our analysis involved forecasting the number of Tumblr users over a decade, improving valuation models, and critically evaluating the original valuation estimates provided by Yahoo.


Key components of the project include:

User Growth Forecasting: Implemented using TBATS and ETS models to capture complex seasonal patterns and volatility in user data.

Data Collection and Feature Engineering: Web scraping of various online data sources to gather relevant financial and operational metrics, followed by data cleaning and feature engineering.

Valuation Model Improvement: Adjusted Tumblrâ€™s valuation using scraped data and empirical calculations, leading to a more realistic assessment of Yahoo's $1.1 billion payment for Tumblr.

Summary Statistics and Visualizations: Generated key summary statistics and visualizations to support the adjusted valuation model and enhance our understanding of Tumblr's market potential.

The repository contains Python code, detailed analysis, and documentation of the methodologies used for forecasting, data collection, and valuation model adjustments.
